The netwire decoder is used to decrypt the traffic generated by a the Netwire
Remote Administration Tool (RAT) or the NetwiredRC family of malware.  The 
traffic is AES 256 bit encrypted between the client and the server.  The tool 
will generate the keys based on the seed values in the traffic and dump the 
decrypted payloads along with the command information.

The supported input types are:
* TCP
