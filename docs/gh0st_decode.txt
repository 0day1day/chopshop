Decoder for gh0st backdoor. The gh0st backdoor is well known and documented.
The structure of the gh0st protocol is:

A 5 byte value.
Length of entire compressed message.
Length of uncompressed zlib payload.
zlib payload (starts with 0x789c).

Once a gh0st message has been found it is buffered until the entire message
is available. Once buffering is complete the message is decompressed.
The first byte of most messages is a command. Known command values are:

0x00: Keepalive
0x01: List drives
0x02: Browse (rest of the message is what to browse)
0x03: Print (rest of the message is what to print)
0x04: Download (has 8 bytes between the command and data)
0x05: Data transfer (has 8 bytes between the command and data)
0x07: Ack?
0x09: Unknown
0x1e: Shell

0x66: System info
0x67: Drive info
0x68: ???
0x69: Unknown
0x6a: Response to 0x03 (print)
0x70: Ack?
0x71: Print drive information
0x72: Print directory listing
0x7a: Unknown
