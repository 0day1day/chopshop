have created a set of standards as to how to reference ChopShop and its different pieces.

* chopshop - References the command line program 'chopshop'
* The core - References the main libraries that make up ChopShop, also sometimes called the 'shop'
* The Library - References the ChopShop Library, i.e., ChopLib located in the shop
* The Ui - References the ChopShop Ui Handler Library, i.e.,  ChopUi located in the shop 
* Primary Module - References a module that ingests the core types that ChopShop supports, namely 'tcp', 'udp', and 'ip'
* Secondary Module - References a module that ingests non-core types that are primary or secondary module defined, e.g., 'http'
